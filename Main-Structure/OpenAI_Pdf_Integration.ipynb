Most of the web 2.0 storage providers store the data in 1\\nor 2 locations which makes the data vulnerable of being lost.\\nSolving these problems IPFS has a decentralised system to store\\nthe data by distributing it amongst multiple nodes and 2-3 copies\\nare stored which makes it extremely safe to use. Coming to\\nvulnerabilities, it can only be attacked by 51% attack which is\\nalmost impossible, so it is safe. Also the data is encrypted before\\nstoring to hide it from a user who the data doesn\\'t belong to or is\\nnot given the access to. There is no simple website that uses IPFS.\\nSo, we\\'ve made a DAPP which ease the things for the user to store\\nthe data in a decentralised way and give them multiple functions to\\nenhance UX.\\n• Using IPFS and Smart Contracts We developed Chain Drive that\\nallows user to access/restrict the data to the given user.\\n• User can allow access, restrict access to particular file uploaded on\\nthe drive.\\nSkills Developed: Solidity, IPFS, React.js, smart contracts,\\nEthereum, Polygon\\nPosition of Responsibility\\nPR Head of Campus Life at my University\\nLink\\n• I used to handle marketing stuffs of non-technical events at\\nuniversity levels as well as to bring up the sponsors that can fund\\nthe events\\n• Campus Life is the community that handles every non-technical\\nand cultural events at my university\\nTechnical Head at Student Community\\n[TechWiz]\\nLink\\n• I have conducted many Technical events in my university at huge\\nlevel.
